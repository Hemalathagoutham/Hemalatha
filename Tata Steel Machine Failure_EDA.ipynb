We'll start by cleaning and organizing the data. Then, we'll look at each piece of information individually and how they relate to each other. We'll use charts and graphs to make it easier to see the patterns and trends. By doing this, we hope to learn about important factors that affect customer satisfaction, sales numbers, product popularity. This knowledge can help make smarter decisions about how to attract more customers, increase sales, develop better products. We'll use Python and some helpful tools for data analysis and visualization. We'll make sure our code is clear and easy to understand.
